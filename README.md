# knorklebot
This is the public repository of the Dr. Knorkles MidJourney Productivity Tool

This application will allow you to quickly generate prompts and can load keywords from file lists or manual lists just like with the MidJourney Permutation feature (execpt with much larger lists), it will then automatically generate each prompt by sending them to the Discord MidJourney bot.
It can also be set up to use the /blend command on images from selected folders. Let's say you have a "celebrities" folder and a "cars" folder full of respective images, selecting these folders and starting the application in blend-mode will make it pick a random image from each folder and blend them together.
The application also have a similar feature for /describe where it can describe entire folders and save the output to several files so that you will get the complete prompts but also separate keywords, artists and phrases as well as giving you a list of weights for different keywords so that you can more easily find patterns when analyzing large amounts of thematic images.
